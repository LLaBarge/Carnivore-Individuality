# questions - is there a latitudinal or productivity gradient associated with

# do less homogeneous habitats promote the use of clusters due to spatial variation

# Importance: predictability in predator behavior - especially consistency in space-use
# is a prerequisite for prey to learn about dangerous locations, resulting in
# spatial risk effects (e.g., 'the landscape of fear'). These spatial risk effects
# are thought to emerge within heterogeneous environments where distinct locations or 
# microhabitats are especially risky for prey. Ambushing hunters that use aspects of 
# habitat structure to conceal themselves before an attack may also facilitate prey
# learning as their hunting domains tend to be narrower than predators that can chase
# prey great distances. These higher latitude locations tend to have a lower diversity
# and abundance of possible prey items, potentially leading to stronger top-down 
# effects on preferred prey species.
# Thus far, however, few studies have examined biogeopgraohical variation in the
# predictability of predator movement and space-use.

# Predictions

# 1) In more heterogeneous habitats, animals may be anchored to locations that are 
# especially good for hunting - resulting in consistent space use and recursion to
# particularly important hunting spots. 1a) Yet, predators in low productivity habitats
# tend to have larger ranges, suggesting that space use variability will be higher
# in these habitats, in order to track prey.
# 1b) In contrast, predators inhabiting homogeneous habitats may have less need to 
# shift their space use due to a more consistent climate, which reduces spatial
# variability in prey forage and abundance.

# Methods: Examine short-term variability in space use using GPS data on Jaguar 
# from a range of biomes in the Americas.

#Metrics:
# Space-use variability: Earth Mover's distance - monthly dbbmm occurrence distributions
# Recursion / revisitation rates:  whether clusters emerge in more heterogeneous 
# environments more often
# Daily maximum distance traveled

# Are these metrics most associated with biome, habitat heterogeneity (from MODIS), 
# potential prey diversity (from literature),
# or body size (e.g., may affect dietary niche, resulting in clustering for those taking particular prey)?
